# Need Your Help - Which APIs Did You Subscribe To?

## The Problem

I've tested 10+ different Amazon APIs on RapidAPI, and all of them return "You are not subscribed to this API."

This means you either:
1. Subscribed to different APIs than the ones I'm testing
2. The subscription hasn't activated yet (can take 5-10 minutes)
3. There's an account mismatch

## What I Need You to Do

**Please check your RapidAPI subscriptions:**

1. Go to: https://rapidapi.com/developer/billing/subscriptions
2. Log in with your account
3. Look at the "Active Subscriptions" section
4. Tell me the **exact names** of the APIs you see there

For example, you might see:
- "Real-Time Amazon Data"
- "Amazon Data Scraper"
- "Amazon Product Search"
- etc.

## Once You Tell Me

Once you tell me the exact API names, I will:
1. Update the Worker to use those specific APIs
2. Test them immediately
3. Get real Amazon.sa products working

## Alternative: Subscribe to Specific APIs

If you haven't subscribed yet or want to start fresh, subscribe to these exact APIs:

**For Amazon:**
- https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data
- Click "Subscribe to Test" → Choose "Basic" (Free)

**For Newegg:**
- I need to search for available Newegg APIs
- Let me know if you found one

## Current Status

- ✅ Worker deployed with RapidAPI integration
- ✅ API key configured
- ❌ Can't access any APIs (not subscribed)
- ⏳ Waiting for you to confirm which APIs you subscribed to

**Please check your subscriptions page and tell me the API names!**
